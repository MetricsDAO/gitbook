# üßëüè´ Web3 Analytics 101: Live Course

## **Overview**

This live course is designed for students who want to answer questions with data, provide context to protocol growth and change, and understand what is happening behind the scenes.

The goal of this live course is to take interested students and teach them the requisite knowledge to be a data analyst in web3. Our goal is that students emerge from the course with an intermediate level of knowledge. We define that as being able to confidently tackle challenges with tools such as Flipside, Dune, Footprint, Dapplooker, etc. While a "beginner" analyst may be limited to high-level overviews, an "intermediate" analyst is able to push beyond surface-level analysis, extracting insights from curiosity-directed exploration.

In short, a successful course will produce a cohort of talented analysts creating great content and actively competing in bounty programs. We will explore Ethereum data throughout this course as it has the most robust tooling and data available. Core concepts can be applied across a range of EVM-compatible chains and alternate blockchains.

## **Format**

We will meet **weekly from November to December 2022** for a live session. Sessions will be recorded. If you have been accepted, be sure to attend the first live session to let us know that you intend to take the rest of the live course! An overview of each segment is available below.

Each week will have accompanying assignments. These will reinforce concepts covered in each live session. The assessment may be a quiz or an analytical prompt that requires querying blockchain data and producing a dashboard or a report. Additionally, members of the course operations team will hold Office Hours weekly in our Discord Server to assist with questions related to the prior week's course. Finally, please actively use the #course-chat channel in MetricsDAO's Discord, under the Education section, to help each other out!

## **Course Outline**

_The following is intended to set expectations about the content of this course, while the content covered will go into more depth than what is listed._

### ****[**‚ÄãSegment 0 - Start Here**](https://docs.metricsdao.xyz/analyst-resources/web3-analytics-101-live-course/segment-0-live-course)**‚Äã**

We have compiled vetted resources that students can dive into, on their own time, to get up to speed with the main topics that this course covers: blockchains and crypto, data analysis using SQL, working in web3, etc. Yes, the content is the same as those used for the async course. It is because these fundamental topics remain valid regardless of the course format. See more on the nested page, __ [_here._ ](segment-0-live-course.md)__\
