# Dos

### 1. Do: Decide on the broad type of dashboard

There are nearly endless types of possible data outputs. As a community analyst of blockchain data, you can often expect to build either:

*   **A** “**dashboard” in the more traditional sense**: A web page that displays the main metrics of interest in one place. It can have interactive features like tabs, filters, and/or parameters. This is a tool that lets the user quickly assess or continuously monitor key data on a protocol, a project, or an entire blockchain. A helpful resource on dashboard design is the book Information Dashboard Design: Displaying Data for At-a-glance Monitoring by Stephen few (full details at the end in the Resources section).

    #### Example

    [https://sociocrypto.gitlab.io/optimism/index.html](https://sociocrypto.gitlab.io/optimism/index.html) by [SocioCrypto](https://twitter.com/SocioCrypto)
*   **A** **data storytelling dashboard or article:** Here you likely have a prompt that you are elaborating on (whether a bounty prompt or self-directed), data visualizations that you draw meaning from, the insights or takeaways that you spotlight, and possibly a background or method on how you arrived at them (and why that background is important). A person looking at this dashboard may be after this very specific question and answer, or they might just be looking for valuable, newsworthy, and entertaining takeaways about the web3 space. This might be made with a dashboard tool e.g. on Flipside or Dune etc., or it can be an article on Mirror or Medium etc. with embedded or screenshotted+linked charts.

**When to choose one over the other?**

In the analytics challenge environment, the bounty question will often do the work for you. E.g. a “megadash” is an example of the first category. On the other hand, a question prompt such as “_How has this frictionless experience impacted Axelar’s token transfer volume via their native bridge Satellite?_” (from [Axelar question 4 “New Kid on the Block](https://www.notion.so/Bounty-Programs-d4bac7f1908f412f8bf4ed349198e5fe)”) calls for a data storytelling output.

Outside of the bounty environment, your clients or stakeholders will likely be looking for one of these over the other, depending on their goals (to display/monitor data, or to deep dive and answer a question).

In data circles, you will commonly hear that your intended **audience** needs to be top of mind as you create and communicate outputs. However, when it comes to analytics challenges, there is a catch. For best results, your work is expected to serve several audiences at once, from peer reviewers who score it, to eager tweeters on Crypto Twitter, to someone who might be looking for a data freelancer or full-time team member, and more. This is a challenging place to be in, and something you probably experienced already, or at least saw other analysts face. The plus side is that you get a chance to define what a successful multi-audience output looks like, and hone your grasp on the best practices you can continue carrying with you throughout your data career.

### 2. **Do: Get clear on your audience(s)**

**Peer Review Network**: Peer reviewers are top analysts in the community who review and score your work. In an analytical challenge, your data output is competing with other analysts for a reward. As important as other audiences are, realistically as a bounty hunter you create competitive data outputs with the goal to outrank other submissions. Competing keeps all analysts on our toes and motivates us to craft the best work we can!

Don’t make the mistake of _only_ targeting this first group, though. As much as the goal of peer review is to reflect what a “strong” dashboard means in the real world, the criteria and trends in peer review will change over time. Plus, review can be subjective. Overfocusing on the above group can stall your long-term progress as an analyst. Standing out with clear, powerful data visualization, storytelling, and presentation, instead of following current peer review trends, can instead propel you and your data career forward.

**The many audience types on Twitter:** It is equally important for your growth as an analyst to make dashboards that do well with other audiences too. Your ticket to a broader audience is blockchain analytics Twitter. Your personal goals with analytics challenges may vary: Maybe you want to keep earning tokens as a bounty hunter, or to keep it freelance and start doing client projects (word is that’s where more \$$$ is), or maybe your goal is to find a job in blockchain data. In all of these cases, have your work be Twitter-ready for the benefit of audiences that include:

* **The curious:** A general audience member who will follow you on Twitter and amplify your posts because your work is attention-grabbing, the tool you built looks helpful, and/or your insights are casually interesting for them to learn.
* **The users of your outputs**: Someone who stays up to date on your work because it helps them in theirs. This may be someone using a dashboard you made and shared because it helps them monitor specific metrics, or a professional in web3 in the niche that your analytical articles cover.
* **The opportunity providers:** Some audience members will see your published work as evidence of your skills and a starting point to collaborate with them further. They may be looking for an analyst for a freelance project or a more permanent position, and your public profile is your portfolio, showcasing not only how well you can do analytics but also your data communication skills.

These groups can overlap. A Twitter follower may also be a peer reviewer, to whom the public interest in your dashboard submission serves as additional evidence of your work’s professionalism. A user of one tool may become interested in working with you on more projects. **Creating data outputs that help and impress more than one of these groups, without putting out work that’s “for everyone and no one”, is one of the great but elusive skills in community blockchain analytics.**

The cool thing is that by being part of the blockchain data analytics community, you are part of defining these best practices in this niche that is very young. Your best dashboards can show other analysts what it means to optimize for peer review AND make something useful for web3 practitioners AND and also be interesting on Twitter at the same time. So far, one defining characteristic of **top dashboards across the space** is that they **have a specific goal and users in mind, and do an effective job at clearly communicating and delivering for them** – and that in turn has a **positive overflow effect** by leading to a higher score and to public interest on Twitter.

We look forward to seeing you grow at making clear, purposeful, effective work that achieves this **elusive combination of specific direction** and **broad interest**.

### 3. Do: Define and deliver on your purpose

Get clear with yourself what you want to accomplish with your analytical output. This goes hand in hand with the 2 Dos above: What the type of dashboard is and who you are envisioning to get value from it.

**Think beyond the peer reviewers.** When you put your dashboard out into the world, be it on Twitter or when the partner protocol who commissioned the analytics challenge receives the results – **who do you envision using your work and how?**

After you get clear on this with yourself, mention directly in your dashboard who you believe will benefit most from it and how, and then deliver on this value.

Are you creating a dashboard to monitor metrics?

* Think about who might find it useful, and what specific metrics they will need. Is it the protocol themselves? Can it be that different teams at the protocol will want different data? Can you separate it out by sections for them?
* Include a **very short About section** that briefly tells your users what data they will find and how they can use it.
* Imagine you are seeing the dashboard for the first time - is it **intuitive and easy to navigate**? E.g. does everyone know how to use parameters? Are they going to find their way around sections or tabs?
* **Ensure the data loads quickly** (one great suggestion is the [10-second rule](https://discord.com/channels/902943676685230100/903386079955128412/1073618483134349404)). If it doesn’t then strongly consider what visuals are essential and which ones can be removed to improve user experience.
* Bonus: All of these tips will be equally beneficial to not only make your metrics-only dashboard practical and useful to a subset of the audience, but also to leave a good impression on someone who stumbles upon it accidentally on Twitter! They too might want to play around with it and share it.

Or instead are you communicating the results of your data analysis (question prompt, data evidence, and takeaways)?

* Envision your **audience**: Someone may be looking for the answer to this specific question, but many of your readers will likely see it as web3 general interest reading.
* It is guaranteed anyone reading your dashboard is busy – Can they skim and still grasp the main insights?
* If someone is reading this do they understand who wrote it, why, what they found, why they should care?

For each of these goals, audiences, and outputs, the rest of the tips will be helpful.

#### Example

[SocioCrypto](https://twitter.com/SocioCrypto) nails explaining the purpose in their [Optimism high level dashboard](https://sociocrypto.gitlab.io/optimism/index.html) previously mentioned in Do tip #1. Each tab of the dashboard quickly orients the user on what they will find there:

### 4. Do: Communicate your Big Idea

Get clear on the **Big Idea:** a one-sentence digest of your analysis. The Big Idea articulates both what you are trying to say, and what’s at stake for your reader – why they should care (Knaflic, p. 30). State your Big Idea in your dashboard. Make it simple enough to be memorable. Reinforce it throughout the analysis to use the power of repetition. (The Big Idea, and the power of repetition in sticky storytelling are ideas that Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic talks about in her book Storytelling with Data.) For a dashboard style that lets the user look up their own metrics instead, you are not exactly giving findings, but its purpose is still worth mentioning in a short About section.

Now go one level down and identify **key elements** or **insights** (something new, interesting, and/or valuable) **that help you illustrate this Big Idea**.

Ideally keep them down to no more than 3 (4 is pushing it) due to [short-term memory limitations](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/magical-number-4-in-shortterm-memory-a-reconsideration-of-mental-storage-capacity/44023F1147D4A1D44BDC0AD226838496) of a human reader. Make sure you are making them clear throughout your piece, and not straying too far on tangents, or too deep into detail.

**It is understandable that you’ve put a lot of work into the analysis and want that to be visible**. But clear communication of your main takeaways will help you achieve that better than a wall of text where the visceral reader reaction is to click out of it.

### 5. Do: Establish a logical structure

Laying out a logical hierarchy of your dashboard will make it more accessible for your readers. Make it skimmer-friendly. Use header levels, tabs, and self-explanatory section names to organize your findings. A reader might even give more attention to your work because they know exactly what they can find and where. The same tip goes for metrics-dashboards (non-storytelling ones): Organize the metrics dashboard with logical tabs, section headings, and other navigation aides your tool provides.

### 6. Do: Define key metrics

Few experiences are more frustrating in reading a data dashboard than a lingering question.

* What makes a wallet in your analysis “active”, or “old” or “new”?
* What are the specific criteria you used to define a “sold-out” NFT collection?
* What does the TVL of this particular protocol contain and why? Why did you choose a particular time span or frequency of measuring your metric?
* What does this abbreviation mean? Define these either towards the start of your dashboard, and/or the first time they come up. The same goes for a metrics-dashboard: You can define metrics next to the chart, or all in a separate Index.

Make your data visualizations into _friendly data graphics_ for your audience (Tufte, p. 183).

### 7. Do: Maximize the signal-to-noise ratio

It is tempting to show the amount of work you did and impress peer reviewers. But **an analysis that says a lot with fewer charts packs a more impactful punch than an analysis with repetitive or unnecessary visualizations**. “**Signal**” adds value to your analysis by helping make your point, while “**noise**” is either redundant, tangential, not informative, or otherwise unnecessary or even distracting (Nancy Duarte cited in Knaflic, p. 72). **Showing the same findings with multiple charts that don’t provide extra information can be a form of noise**.

#### Example

Do you want to show the same variable in daily, monthly, and annual frequency where the trends are the same? Build one chart with a **parameter** – let the user select one frequency at a time. Mention on the side that all options show the same underlying trend (if they do). That’s a chart that packs a lot of data ink in a small amount of space!

### 8. Do: Use best practices for visuals

There are many resources on chart and graph design, among them Storytelling with Data by C. N. Knaflic and The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (a classic) by Edward Tufte. Some tips are also tool-specific. But here is a shortlist of general tips, mostly from Knaflic’s book:

* **Avoid donut and pie charts** if you can. In most cases, charts that use areas (including pie and donut charts) are difficult for the human brain to process. This is especially tricky if you are comparing pie slices that are not drastically different, or comparing two pie or donut charts side by side. Try a **100% normalized stacked horizontal bar graph** instead (or a **regular vertical bar graph** with multiple series, or just **single-number graphics** on their own) (check out Knaflic pp. 234-240 for a case study “Alternatives to pies”).
  *   Example from Elizabeth Ricks’ [post](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2020/5/14/what-is-a-pie-chart) about pie charts on the _Storytelling with Data_ blog:

      [https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2020/5/14/what-is-a-pie-chart](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2020/5/14/what-is-a-pie-chart)
* **Avoid double Y axes**, they are not intuitive to read. Instead, you can put two charts side by side.
* When you only need to communicate one data point, a **single-number graphic** (e.g. Flipside dashboard tool has one) works great.
* A **scatterplot** shows a relationship between two metrics. You don’t have to determine whether the relationship is causal or simply correlation in order to use a scatterplot (just communicate this clearly to your audience).
* **Line charts** emphasize movement (usually through time).
* **Bar charts** are great for comparison, because human eyes find them easy to contrast. Vertical bar charts are awesome, horizontal – even better.
* Although try to **avoid stacked bar charts** if you have **more than two categories**. The visual advantage goes away and values become harder to compare. Or, you can make it normalized to 100% to help the eye.

### 9. Do: Ask for feedback

Your Peer Reviewers often give feedback on your work, but another great place to hear from analysts and consumers of data is, again, Twitter. When you share your dashboard and findings, mention that you would like to receive feedback! If someone engages in conversation about your output, ask them specific questions about what they liked or wanted different. It is up to you to discuss or incorporate any feedback, but it is helpful to hear it.
