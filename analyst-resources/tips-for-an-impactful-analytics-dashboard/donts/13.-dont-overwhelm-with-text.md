# 13. Don’t: Overwhelm with text

For instance, imagine a hypothetical dashboard where you have plotted the number of monthly sales for an NFT collection for 6 months. How can you optimize the real estate next to this chart?

Instead of writing something like this self-explanatory description:

“_The number of monthly sales for an NFT collection trended up for the past 6 months:_

_In January it was A tokens sold._

_In February it was B tokens, B-A tokens more._

_In March and April each, C NFTs were sold._

_May saw a brief decrease, back to February levels with B sales._

_June had the record number of sales in this collection, with more than D sales.”_

try something like:

_“NFT sale count shows an uptrend, and combined with data in the previous chart this indicates possible concentration:_

* _The number of monthly sales for an NFT collection trended up for the past 6 months from January to June (minus a brief decrease in May)_.
* _On the chart above we saw that the number of unique monthly buyer wallets consistently decreased in the same time span. This indicates that the collection is concentrating in a smaller subset of wallets._
* _Is this trend neutral, positive, or negative? The next section helps us understand the implications._”
