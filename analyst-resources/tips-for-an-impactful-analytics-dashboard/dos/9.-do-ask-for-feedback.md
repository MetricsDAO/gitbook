# 9. Do: Ask for feedback

Your Peer Reviewers often give feedback on your work, but another great place to hear from analysts and consumers of data is, again, Twitter. When you share your dashboard and findings, mention that you would like to receive feedback! If someone engages in conversation about your output, ask them specific questions about what they liked or wanted different. It is up to you to discuss or incorporate any feedback, but it is helpful to hear it.
