# 6. Do: Define key metrics

Few experiences are more frustrating in reading a data dashboard than a lingering question.

* What makes a wallet in your analysis “active”, or “old” or “new”?
* What are the specific criteria you used to define a “sold-out” NFT collection?
* What does the TVL of this particular protocol contain and why? Why did you choose a particular time span or frequency of measuring your metric?
* What does this abbreviation mean? Define these either towards the start of your dashboard, and/or the first time they come up. The same goes for a metrics-dashboard: You can define metrics next to the chart, or all in a separate Index.

Make your data visualizations into _friendly data graphics_ for your audience (Tufte, p. 183).
