# 5. Do: Establish a logical structure

Laying out a logical hierarchy of your dashboard will make it more accessible for your readers. Make it skimmer-friendly. Use header levels, tabs, and self-explanatory section names to organize your findings. A reader might even give more attention to your work because they know exactly what they can find and where. The same tip goes for metrics-dashboards (non-storytelling ones): Organize the metrics dashboard with logical tabs, section headings, and other navigation aides your tool provides.
