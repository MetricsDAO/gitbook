# Don'ts

### 10. Don’t: Disregard your audience’s background knowledge (and other context)

One example of thinking about context is the level of background knowledge your audience has. If you share your dashboard with the peer reviewers at MetricsDAO and also on your Twitter, your readers will likely be familiar with the web3 space, have the basics of web3 down, or at least know where to find more details. **You might not want to start your work with a copied and pasted, generic, and lengthy description of the web3 project you are analyzing**. Most of your audience may find it redundant – not to mention unoriginal when they open another dashboard to get additional insights and instead find the same description. This is an easy “Ugh” moment to avoid. Instead, mention in your own words the minimum amount of background needed, and link to more details in case a one-off reader may be unfamiliar with the details, or someone wants to dive deep.

### 11. Don’t: Go too technical in the methodology (save it for the appendix if necessary)

One common pitfall is a too detailed methodology section. It may sound counterintuitive to “Answer questions before they are asked”, but while your basic analytical decisions are important to mention, very few readers (some of the peer reviewers and probably a fellow analyst or two) want to get very technical. For their sake, **the end of your dashboard or article is a great place for a more detailed methods appendix**, \*\*\*\*if you have one. You can also externalize this type of information as a separate page or article, for those who want to dive deeper.

**In the body of your work, lead with the general-audience version of your methodology,** and mention where to dig deeper for the rest.

### 12. Don’t: Overwhelm with charts

A dashboard that sets out to answer a specific analytical challenge prompt, but instead plots anything and everything to do with a particular protocol, will likely make your reader (and your peer reviewers) walk away without specific takeaways and insights. That is, if they are patient enough for the many charts to finally load.

Instead, the Do tip # 7 (maximizing the data ink and minimizing noise) is a better direction to take. Reduce the **cognitive load** (Knaflic, p. 71) that a busy reader (or reviewer) must devote to understanding your analysis. You want to avoid the reader’s cognitive load reaching a tipping point, where they either speed-scroll to the end, or altogether give up and close the tab.

### 13. Don’t: Overwhelm with text

Even if your dashboard is of the “take a prompt and explain your findings” variety, you don’t always need to explain each visualization. The chart may already be self-explanatory, or maybe you decide to tell the story at the start or end of a section covering several charts at once.

If you do explain a chart, avoid going on too long, and repeating what the reader can already see. Use text boxes powerfully: make connections, briefly explain the important parts of your thinking, and connect back to your Big Idea and your key takeaways. Like in Don’t tip #12 above – reduce the cognitive load a.k.a. any communication that doesn’t add something absolutely important to your main idea.

#### Example

For instance, imagine a hypothetical dashboard where you have plotted the number of monthly sales for an NFT collection for 6 months. How can you optimize the real estate next to this chart?

Instead of writing something like this self-explanatory description:

“_The number of monthly sales for an NFT collection trended up for the past 6 months:_

_In January it was A tokens sold._

_In February it was B tokens, B-A tokens more._

_In March and April each, C NFTs were sold._

_May saw a brief decrease, back to February levels with B sales._

_June had the record number of sales in this collection, with more than D sales.”_

try something like:

_“NFT sale count shows an uptrend, and combined with data in the previous chart this indicates possible concentration:_

* _The number of monthly sales for an NFT collection trended up for the past 6 months from January to June (minus a brief decrease in May)_.
* _On the chart above we saw that the number of unique monthly buyer wallets consistently decreased in the same time span. This indicates that the collection is concentrating in a smaller subset of wallets._
* _Is this trend neutral, positive, or negative? The next section helps us understand the implications._”

### 14. Don’t: Submit without proofreading spelling and grammar

This one seems trivial but isn’t! Your dashboard is part of your public body of work. It signals your professionalism. Do not skip proofreading, and if you would like an extra grammar or spelling check, there are software tools that can help!
