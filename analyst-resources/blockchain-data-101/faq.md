#### How do I get some POAPs?&#x20;

You will have a chance to earn a POAP after each session. To be eligible for the POAP, complete the weekly quiz with a score of 7/10 or higher!

If you passed a quiz successfully (scored a 7 or more out of 10), please wait **a few days after completing the quiz**, and claim your POAP at the link:

* [Week 1](https://poap.delivery/blockchainanalytics1)
* [Week 2](https://poap.delivery/mdao-workshop-blockchain-analytics-2/)

Announcement about claiming each week's POAP are posted on Discord in [#course-faq](https://discord.com/channels/902943676685230100/996143485390426162).&#x20;

Be sure to use the same Ethereum address that you submitted in the quiz form. Please be patient as we whitelist the addresses, as it is not an automatic process. Please note that "POAPs Left" is the number of people who are _currently_ whitelisted. More people will become eligible as we process the quiz forms!

#### How do I earn xMETRIC in the course?

Everyone who passes the weekly quizzes with a score of 7/10 or higher will receive 10 xMETRIC!
