#### How do I get some POAPs?&#x20;

You will have a chance to earn a POAP after each session. To be eligible for the POAP, complete the weekly quiz with a score of 7/10 or higher!

If you passed Quiz 1 successfully (scored a 7 or more out of 10), visit [**this link**](https://poap.delivery/blockchainanalytics1) **a few days after completing the quiz**, and claim your POAP! Be sure to use the same Ethereum address that you submitted in the Quiz 1 form.&#x20;

Please be patient as we whitelist the addresses, as it is not an automatic process.&#x20;

Please note that "POAPs Left" is the number of people who are _currently_ whitelisted, and there is no hard limit to the number of POAPs. More people will become eligible as we process the quiz forms!

#### How do I earn xMETRIC in the course?

Everyone who passes the weekly quizzes with a score of 7/10 or higher will also receive 10 xMETRIC!

xMETRIC is a beta-testing token recently launched by MetricsDAO. It represents your early MetricsDAO participation on-chain, and will unlock token-gated roles and opportunities. Learn more about xMETRIC in this [post](https://blog.metricsdao.xyz/xmetric/).
