## **Educational Bounties: Dune edition**

We have developed two additional open bounty-style questions for students to attempt! Check out questions 3 and 4 on the Blockchain Analytics Course Practice Bounties page.&#x20;

Each of these have components that you should be able to readily tackle with the SQL we have learned thus far, and the Dune tables. There are also challenges built-in to the questions, to go beyond and produce broader and deeper analysis and visualizations.

These questions provide guidance on the Dune tables where you can start your analysis. In other aspects, these bounty questions are similar to the questions you previously explored with Flipside, in the previous round of course bounties. But just because the questions are similar in this round, your analysis doesn't have to be! The questions are designed to give you as the analyst considerable freedom for the directions your dashboard can take. Feel free to expand your data analysis range!

Please note: these bounties are for your benefit! There will not be a formal review process as with paid bounties, but you are more than welcome to ask for advice in any of the educational Discord channels, or for some live help during Office Hours.

Participants in August can earn 100 xMetric just by submitting a dashboard!&#x20;
