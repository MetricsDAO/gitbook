# Office Hours 4

#### Q: Do you have any tips for solving Course Bounties 3 & 4: Dune Edition?&#x20;

A: Some useful tips:

* Check out the Dune table and version hints in the [bounty questions](https://metricsdao.notion.site/metricsdao/Bounty-Programs-d4bac7f1908f412f8bf4ed349198e5fe?p=8e6be1bfef4a4e0f87887d857b7dad96\&pm=c) to get you started!&#x20;
* Refer to Chuxin’s [dashboard](https://docs.metricsdao.xyz/analyst-resources/blockchain-data-101/segment-4/sql-in-dune-v2-vs-v1) created for this course.&#x20;
* Look at sample dashboards built by other analysts on Dune’s [discover page](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards).
* For the Uniswap vs. Sushiswap DEX comparison bounty, Dune wizard **hildobby**’s dashboard “[DEX Pool Deep Dive Uniswap/Sushiswap](https://dune.com/hildobby/DEX-Pool-Deep-Dive)” is a helpful reference.&#x20;
* Queries in Dune wizard dashboards can be complex, but you can look at specific parts of them to help with your SQL! Try a Ctrl + F search inside an analyst’s query to find the keywords you need.

#### Q: What SQL query writing best practices do you recommend?

A: Left comma vs. right comma is optional, but be consistent with one or the other! Other query writing tips include staying consistent with upper/lowercase, providing comments on your query’s logic, and creating good documentation where applicable.

#### Q: Some data & abstractions in Dune are user-generated. For anyone interested in contributing to data curation in Dune, where to start?&#x20;

A: For analytics engineering with dbt, check out Dune’s [Spellbook](https://docs.dune.com/dune-engine-v2-beta/abstractions-in-dunev2/introducing-spellbook), and [MetricsDAO’s data curation pod](https://docs.metricsdao.xyz/data-curation/data-curation) (an upcoming project for the latter is Terra 2.0 data).

Tutorials on data curation using dbt:&#x20;

* Chuxin led a [dbt workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj\_2ljFABuA) at MetricsDAO,
* Andrew Hong’s [Sudoswap walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zReSzVdV2s) also contains dbt material.
