# 🧑🏫 Blockchain Data 101

## Overview

This course is designed for students who want to answer questions with data, provide context to protocol growth and change, and understand what is happening behind the scenes.

The goal of this course is to take interested students and teach them the requisite knowledge to be a data analyst in web3. Our goal is that students emerge from the course with an intermediate level of knowledge. We define that as being able to confidently tackle challenges with tools such as [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz), [Dune](https://dune.com), [Footprint](https://footprint.network), [Dapplooker](https://dapplooker.com), etc. While a "beginner" analyst may be limited to high-level overviews, an "intermediate" analyst is able to push beyond surface-level analysis, extracting insights from curiosity-directed exploration.

In short, a successful course will produce a cohort of talented analysts creating great content and actively competing in bounty programs.

We will explore Ethereum data throughout this course as it has the most robust tooling and data available. Core concepts can be applied across a range of EVM-compatible chains and alternate blockchains.

### Format

We will meet **weekly in August on Mondays at 20:00 UTC** for a live session. This will be recorded and available on the [MetricsDAO YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDyRizBgObJB-sNuwEPlL1g) for those that can not make the live session. An overview of each segment is available below.

Each week will have accompanying assignments. These will reinforce concepts covered in each live session. The assessment may be a quiz or an analytical prompt that require querying blockchain data and producing a dashboard or a report.

Additionally, members of the course operations team will hold Office Hours weekly in [our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/H9ggUCNXt5) to assist with questions related to the prior week's course.

Finally, please actively use the #course-chat channel in MetricsDAO's Discord, under the Education section, to help each other out!

## Course Outline

_The following is intended to set expectations about the content of this course, while the content covered will go into more depth than what is listed._

### [Segment 0 - Start Here](../../get-involved/blockchain-data-101/segment-0.md)

We will be compiling vetted resources that students can dive into, on their own time, to get up to speed with the main topics that this course covers: blockchains and crypto, data analysis using SQL, working in web3, etc.

See more on the nested page, [here](../../get-involved/blockchain-data-101/segment-0.md).

* [What is xMETRIC?](https://blog.metricsdao.xyz/xmetric/)

### [Segment 1 - The Basics](segment-1/)

Establishing foundational knowledge

* Blockchain, distilled, and what is Ethereum?
* Data
  * What tools are out there?
    * We will primarily use [Flipside](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com) and [Dune](https://dune.com/). I suggest signing up for both websites (for free) and familiarizing yourself with them!
  * Accessing curated datasets and using SQL to explore blockchain data.
* Why do this kind of work?
  * The analytics ecosystem and work2earn.

### [Segment 2 - Building Blocks](segment-2/)

Expand technical abilities with live use-cases.

* Available data
  * Exploratory analysis and understanding what we're looking at.
  * Observing trends with high-level aggregations.
  * Comparing Ethereum transactions in data tables to block explorers.
* Domain knowledge - understanding your subject
* Exploring data through visual representations

### [Segment 3 - Leveling Up](segment-3/)

Introducing intermediate SQL techniques and diving into (more) raw transaction data.

* SQL Aggregations - benefits and pitfalls
* Data, uncurated
  * Moving beyond `ez_` tables working with JSON message objects.

### [Segment 4 - Dune](https://docs.metricsdao.xyz/analyst-resources/blockchain-data-101/segment-4)

Expert session led by Dune Wizard [chuxin.eth](https://twitter.com/chuxin\_h).

* SQL syntax: Dune Engine V2 vs. V1&#x20;
* Column-oriented data
* Using Dune abstractions
* Cross-chain analysis

### [Segment 5 - Tying it all together](https://docs.metricsdao.xyz/analyst-resources/blockchain-data-101/segment-5)

In the closing session of the course, [Forg](https://twitter.com/forgash\_), [GJ](https://twitter.com/GJFlannery19) and [Rob](https://twitter.com/robplust) discuss:&#x20;

* Creating professional outputs
