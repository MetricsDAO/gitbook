## **Educational Bounty**

We have developed two open bounty-style questions for students to attempt! Each of these have components that you should be able to readily tackle with the SQL we have learned thus far and the `ez_` tables on Flipside.&#x20;

There are also challenges built-in to the question to go beyond the curated `ez_` tables and venture into the wild west of `fact_transactions` and `fact_event_logs`.

Please note: these bounties are for your benefit! There will not be a formal review process as with paid bounties, but you are more than welcome to ask for advice in any of the educational Discord channels, or for some live help during Office Hours!

Participants in August can earn 100 xMetric just by submitting a dashboard!

Finally, I suggest you use the Flipside tables for these as the next live session is all about Dune and students should try converting what they do here into a Dune dashboard, after that lesson, to really go above and beyond.
