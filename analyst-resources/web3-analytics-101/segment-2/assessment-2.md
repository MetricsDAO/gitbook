## We talkin' practice??

### Port the queries to Dune!

So far, we have been using the `ez_` tables from Flipside because they're incredibly clean and curated data, which makes for easy learning and great test sets. We'll be moving beyond these to the Flipside `fact_` tables and Dune's V2 tables.&#x20;

In the meantime, a great way to practice the skills we have learned thus far would be to take each example query and try to replicate them in Dune or even with the raw transactions in Flipside's `ethereum.core.fact_transactions`. Share your results in [Discord](https://discord.gg/metrics) if you do!

### Try a Bounty!

In addition to this assessment, try an old bounty! All past questions are listed on the bounty page (linked below). There are some questions in there that y'all can definitely answer! Find one that is of interest to you and give it a shot! Bring your work to the Discord channels or to Office Hours and we'll be happy to provide some feedback and help.

### Need help?

Getting somewhere, but stuck? The showcase celebrates all the fantastic work the MetricsDAO community is creating. Queries are open-source and we believe in building in public, it's ok to check how someone did something for some inspiration. That's a great way to learn that there are many ways to solve the same problem at hand!

However, straight-up taking someones work and calling it your own is not alright. If you borrow someone's hard work, credit them appropriately. And when you do get to the bounty stage in your development, remember that each and every submission is reviewed. We have, unfortunately, had to disqualify copiers from payment in the past.
