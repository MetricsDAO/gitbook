# Providing Effective Feedback

Effective feedback is crucial for the growth and development of our analysts. Giving and receiving feedback can be challenging, but it is an essential part of the Peer Review process. Here are some best practices for writing effective feedback that can help analysts improve.

## Tips for Reviewers

### Use a neutral tone and language

Be mindful of your language: Avoid using negative or judgmental language. Instead of using "you", it is better to use a neutral tone and talk about "the submission". We evaluate submissions, not people. This is less   confrontational and allows the recipient to focus on the feedback rather than feeling personally attacked.&#x20;

### Mention the good things

It is essential to recognize and acknowledge the efforts and accomplishments of the analyst. Positive feedback helps to build confidence and motivation.

### Be specific

Instead of general statements, reference specific parts of the submission. This will help analysts understand where they need to focus their efforts.&#x20;

### Personalize your feedback

Show that you have read the submission. This will make the feedback more meaningful to the analyst and increase the chances that they will take the feedback to heart. When possible, give feedback on the whole work.

### Familiarize yourself with our policy on plagiarism

It is important to remind analysts of the importance of originality and to provide guidance on what constitutes plagiarism.&#x20;

### Know the difference between plagiarism, forking, and citing

Know the difference between plagiarism, forking someone else’s work, and citing content from other sources. True plagiarism is a serious offense. Make sure you know what constitutes plagiarism before applying this label. On the other hand, don’t hesitate to call it out when you see it.&#x20;

### Share best practices

Feedback is not just about pointing out mistakes; it is also about sharing best practices and knowledge. Share some advice and resources that can help the analyst improve.
