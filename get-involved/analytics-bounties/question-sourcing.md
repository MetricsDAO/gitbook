# 1- Question Sourcing

Help surface analytical prompts on [https://bounty.metricsdao.xyz/](https://bounty.metricsdao.xyz/) !

Question sourcing is the first step in the analytics bounty program. The questions for bounties might be supplied by the protocol **or** they might be sourced by the community depending on the type of bounty program.



If the questions are being supplied by the community then the person asking the question(s) **usually** gets paid-

1-  10$ for each valid question that is **NOT** selected for solution generation

2- 30$ for each valid question that is selected for solution generation

_Note_- No money is paid if the question has already been asked or if it is too similar to another question.



_Also note that the Question generation process will be different in the future_ - An author will have to lock their $METRIC token against their Question. Authors may upvote a question by locking more $METRIC against a question. Upvoting a question will decrease the activation time of a question which means that the question will become more prioritized. Authors will be rewarded with partner tokens for locking their $METRIC against a question. $METRIC will be available to the authors through a faucet.
