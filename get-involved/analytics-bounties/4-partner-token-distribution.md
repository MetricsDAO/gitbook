# 4- Partner token distribution

Payments are sent out to the authors,analysts and the reviewers after the review process is completed. The authors,analysts and the reviewers are usually paid in either the partner tokens or in stable coins. MetricsDAO is actively working to reduce the time taken in this payment process so the payments are expected to be sent out within a week or two.
