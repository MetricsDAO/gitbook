# 3- Reviewing the solutions

In the third step, the submitted Dashboards are reviewed by the reviewers. They grade the dashboard according to this grading rubric. The review process usually takes a few days

The submission graders are paid 25 USDC per hour. To become a Reviewer, interested candidates can approach Kakamora or DigitalDan in the MetricsDAO discord server. The candidate will need to fill out a form describing their relevant experience.

In the future - Reviewers will also be required to lock their $METRIC in order to review the bounties(see [whitepaper](https://metricsdao.xyz/docs/metricsdao-whitepaper-2022.pdf)). The token will be unlocked once the review process is over.
