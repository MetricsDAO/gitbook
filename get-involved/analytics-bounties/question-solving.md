# 2- Generating solutions

Our active bounty programs are live on Notion:

{% embed url="https://metricsdao.notion.site/metricsdao/Bounty-Programs-d4bac7f1908f412f8bf4ed349198e5fe" %}

**For now** ,A set of bounty questions usually become active for a week during which they can tackled by the analysts. The solution dashboard should be submitted before the deadline passes. There is no need to claim a bounty in MetricsDAO's analytics program, this means that anyone can submit a dashboard for a particular bounty before a deadline is reached. The submission is then reviewed by the reviewers that grade the submission. The analysts are paid(in either partner tokens or stablecoins) according to the grade that their submission receives. The grading rubric according to which the analysts are graded can be found [here](https://metricsdao.notion.site/Bounty-Evaluation-Rubric-91cda06db37e49c1884950b6c9e15f75).&#x20;

**Later on**, analysts will be required to claim a particular bounty by locking their $METRIC token against that bounty. The analysts will be needed to submit the dashboard before the question expires. The Analystâ€™s $METRIC will be unlocked after the submission period ends.( check the [whitepaper](https://metricsdao.xyz/docs/metricsdao-whitepaper-2022.pdf) for more info). The submission will then be reviewed by the reviewers that grade the submission. The analysts will be paid(in either partner tokens or stablecoins) according to the grade that their submission receives. The grading rubric according to which the analysts are graded can be found [here](https://metricsdao.notion.site/Bounty-Evaluation-Rubric-91cda06db37e49c1884950b6c9e15f75).&#x20;



_Note that the submission must be publicly available in order for it to be graded_
