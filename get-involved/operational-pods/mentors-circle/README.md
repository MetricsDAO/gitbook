# Mentor's Circle

Our Mentors can help you get started on your on-chain analytics journey or help you take your skills to the next level! Look for the Mentor role in Discord and keep your eyes out for monthly workshops starting in 2022!

Interested in joining as a Mentor? We can always use additional help with workshop planning and creation, developing the Mentor's Circle roadmap, or just being a resource within our Discord. We are also always open to guests running a workshop or collaborating with another team.

Reach out to anduril#4790, forg#9122 or hildobby#0001 to get involved!

## Direct Help via Office Hours

Our mentors run regular Office Hours in the # ðŸ”Š | Build-In-Public channel. Look out for the Discord Events **"Data and Chill"** led by any of our Mentor's Circle Leadership Team for help with whatever you're working on.

Make sure to self-select the @Apprentices role and find other learners in [# ðŸ““ | apprentices](https://discord.com/channels/902943676685230100/948007491441143808)! This role will also be pinged for workshop reminders and ad-hoc sessions in the public voice channels!

## Workshops

Our next workshop will be **A Guide to Data Curation** with chuxin.eth on March 11th! This will be a nice overview of the tools and skills needed to contribute to MetricsDAO as a Data Curator.

A full list of past and upcoming workshops is available here:
