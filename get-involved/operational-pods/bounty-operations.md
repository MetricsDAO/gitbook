# Bounty Operations

Bounty Ops is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the bounty program. The team administers the question generation process, the publication of bounties, the grading of submissions, and the payments of submissions.

Bounty Ops also allocates work to #Reviewers on an as-and-when requested basis. This work consists of grading bounty submissions and doing quality control on bounty questions. Candidates for the #Reviewer role must complete an application form.

Bounty Ops benefits from members who are action oriented and possess good attention to detail.
