# Protocol Development

The protocol development team is focused on building out the code required to enable MetricsDAO to operate autonomously on the blockchain. This includes the METRIC token, as well as the entire lifecycle of a bounty question as described in the [Whitepaper](https://metricsdao.xyz/docs/metricsdao-whitepaper-2022.pdf).
