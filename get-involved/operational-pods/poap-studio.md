# POAP Studio

As of writing (Q4 2021), the achievements and contributions that will earn POAPs are still being determined. If you have ideas about how and why POAPs should be rewarded, please [start a discussion on Discourse](https://discourse.metricsdao.xyz/c/metricsdao/5).&#x20;

## POAP Distribution

MetricsDAO may use whitelist based or claim link distribution depending on the data available.

### Whitelist Based Distribution

When the addresses of the individuals who the POAP is to be distributed are available or can be collected, this method is easiest.

A set of addresses can be entered when creating the POAP and those users can then claim the POAP.

Use [POAP Delivery](https://app.poap.xyz/admin/deliveries/new)&#x20;

### Claimable Links

When the list of addresses is unknown and/or can't be collected, a specific number of POAPs can be minted. For each POAP in the series, a unique claim code is generated. These must then be distributed to the users who earned or get to claim the POAP.

Use [POAP Events](https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events/new)
