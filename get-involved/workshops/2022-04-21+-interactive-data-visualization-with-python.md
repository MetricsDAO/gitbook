# 2022-04-21+ Interactive Data Visualization with Python

### Overview

While Flipside and Dune are great platforms for dashboard creation, some use cases require more flexibility. This includes creating customized reports, more complicated visualizations, or statistical analysis.

This Learn in Public series will go over the basics of interactive data visualizations, and alternative ways to share dashboards without having to host your own web server (and no Javascript experience!).

### Scope

Learn in Public is meant to be a hands-on series, meeting weekly over approximately one month. Participants are highly encouraged to complete the assigned tasks from the week and be involved in discussion. There are suggested prerequisites necessary to be able to fully participate.

For this series, participants would be expected to have some basic coding and data analysis knowledge, ideally in Python (though other languages like R would probably translate).

### Description

The first part of this course will cover the [Altair Visualization Library](https://altair-viz.github.io/), focusing on the notebooks from this [Data Visualization Curriculum](https://github.com/uwdata/visualization-curriculum) (3 weeks).

The second part of this course will turn these data visualizations into dashboards, using [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) or [datapane](https://datapane.com/) (details will be determined and updated). Weâ€™ll end with a submission for a Metrics DAO bounty using the new skills learned in the course.

There will be assignments to be completed before each weekly discussion, so that everyone has already had a chance to complete the work before going over it in more details. Each week will be led by a moderator who will walk through that week's assignment, facilitate discussion and help answer questions.

### **Background Material / Prerequisites**

Basic knowledge of Python, or another programming language is required. This series is not designed for complete beginners to coding**.** &#x20;

Here are some resources to learn Python for future endeavors!

* [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-python)
* [Practical Python Programming](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/)
* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
* [The Python Open Source Computer Science Degree](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs-python)
* [Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/)

### Bonus Assignments

#### UST/LUNA price data

We have a dataset of hourly UST and LUNA price information. Let's use it to make a chart!

The query used to get the dataset is [here](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity/queries/5a8cda2b-30f4-4179-a91b-86aace3a0d69) and can be read into python with the following code:

```python
url = "https://api.flipsidecrypto.com/api/v2/queries/5a8cda2b-30f4-4179-a91b-86aace3a0d69/data/latest"
df = pd.read_json(url)
```

Create a new cell in one of the Colab notebooks, run those lines to create your DataFrame, and then use the Altair knowledge you have to visualize the data.

To see some examples, scroll down to the bottom of [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11RV4Be4DNaS-hEOdcDJ-SaSrL4YY7QHH?usp=sharing).
