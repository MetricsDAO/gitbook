## A New Future

What stands between a future in which you are free to work from anywhere in the world, and your insights and analysis driving real change and understanding in the blockchain economy, a world in which your list of POAPs makes you the in-demand OG of the 2025 cycle of innovation?

I ask this question because as seemingly improbable as that future sounds, it is possible if you are willing to start the journey, and this lesson zero may very well be that first step if you are brand new to the on-chain analysis field.

### What will you learn by reviewing Lesson Zero? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-02d14b97-7fff-7546-0abc-3b8bee113ae3" id="docs-internal-guid-02d14b97-7fff-7546-0abc-3b8bee113ae3"></a>

After completion, you will have the essential knowledge of relational databases and Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL will be the fundamental tool you'll use to interact with blockchain data across popular analytics platforms such as Dune Analytics, Flipside, a host of third party providers, and, of course, MetricsDAO. These platforms have taken raw blockchain data through an additional step of parsing the data using an ETL (extract-transform-load) layer and simplified the data into simpler relational databases.

You'll also learn the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology so that the terminologies you'll see in the databases such as block number, addresses, block hash, etc. will be second nature to you.

Once equipped with these two important tools, you’re on your way towards that new future.

### How will you learn in Lesson Zero?

This is a purely self-paced lesson. However, you can drop in to the Discord channel [#course-chat](https://discord.com/channels/902943676685230100/992490932412883064) to ask questions and interact with your fellow classmates and (instructor?)

Okay, excited and ready to get started? Let's go!

## SQL

There are a couple of ways to learn. I find that I can read a lot faster than I can listen, so back when I had to learn SQL quickly some years ago, I picked up[ Sam's Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes](https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Minutes-Sams-Teach-Yourself-ebook/dp/B07ZKVJPR8/ref=sr\_1\_3?keywords=Teach+Yourself+SQL+in+20+minutes\&qid=1656449023\&sr=8-3). The title contains a small lie. They really mean 10 minutes a day, but you can read cover-to-cover in about 4 hours.

If you learn best through exercises, [Mode](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/) has a complete set from beginner to advanced on sample tables to get you started.

## Blockchain Concepts

You'll only need to watch [Lesson 1 Blockchain Basics](https://youtu.be/gyMwXuJrbJQ?t=547) of the Blockchain & Solidity Smart Contract course. The lesson's run time is 1:50:00. The instructor uses excellent web tools to help you understand why blockchain is such a potent technology, and he will cover a lot of the basic terminologies you'll see in the analytics databases.\
For the learner who would prefer to read, [here’s a good beginner resource](https://www.odysseydao.com/pathways/intro-to-web3). The recommended readings are the first four lessons of Intro to Web3, but you are encouraged to read more if you have the time.

## Congratulations!

You have made it through that crucial first step. You have actually learned quite a lot, and you’re ready for the rest of the classes!
