<mark style="color:yellow;">**Collaboration Highlight:**</mark> danner.ust#7297 & hfuhruhurr#8781 collaborated on 2021-12-22 to align on usage of GitHub, dbt and Snowflake. This resulted in the following findings and improvements to our process:&#x20;

* Added guardrails so there cannot be direct updates to main
* Now merges cannot be done without a review and approval
  * Don't be afraid to open PRs and ask questions :)&#x20;
* This is a great example of how partner collaboration can yield learnings for both individuals and process improvements for the larger group!&#x20;
  * Is there a subject area you'd like to cover in a Build In Public setting? Time can be scheduled with danner.ust#7297 for [30 Mins](https://calendly.com/danner\_eth/30min?month=2021-12) or [60 Mins](https://calendly.com/danner\_eth/60min?month=2021-12)&#x20;
