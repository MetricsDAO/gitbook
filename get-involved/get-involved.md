## What will I do as a participant? <a href="#what-will-i-do-as-a-participant" id="what-will-i-do-as-a-participant"></a>

There are a variety of tasks to enable effective Metrics outcomes.&#x20;

To name a few:&#x20;

* Suggesting questions that require analysis
* Structuring analytics programs
* Reviewing dashboards, charts and visualizations for quality control

Most importantly, this will be an open forum for active dialogue and learning about all things analytics.

Come raise your hand; there will be plenty to do, and no shortage of benefits for those who want to empower analytical minds, and help protocols succeed.
