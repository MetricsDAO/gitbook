# 2- Analytics

**Component 2: Analytics**

â‡’To Generate Insights & Drive User Onboarding

MetricsDAOâ€™s community of analysts creates the analytics, tooling and content protocols need. With this component DAOs can choose to activate the questions sourced from the community brainstorm, or submit their own questions or tasks that need solving.

Activating MetricsDAOâ€™s analysts allows organizations to not only generate the insights they need, but it also onboards new analysts and new users to their protocol.
