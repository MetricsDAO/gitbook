# Overview

## Guiding Principles

* Each role is valuable; one is not better than another&#x20;
* Each role should receive value, by virtue of being a participant in MetricsDAO&#x20;
* Members progress via taking additional ownership&#x20;
* The DAO is owned by the members&#x20;
* Accepting more responsibility leads to gaining more ownership
* Nothing is permanent; members can go from one role to another over time&#x20;
* The path from one role to another is clear and transparent to all members

### **Community**

Participant but not yet activated as a Contributor.

### **Contributor**

&#x20;Project or pod based functions. Critical to project success. Contributors can graduate to Core.

### **Core**

Responsible for execution and implementation of vision. Lead and/or participate in Pods with Contributors.

### **Council**

Guide vision and offer insights. Sets general direction and has great impact (and responsibility) to shape this initiative.&#x20;

### Genesis Members

Indicative of when a member joined the strategic and advisory level. More of a statement of provenance than delineation of operational responsibility.

### **Bootstrap**

Responsible for providing resources and implementing administrative and technological infrastructure to get the initiative off the ground.
