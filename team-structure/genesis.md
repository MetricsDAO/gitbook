## Who We Are <a href="#who-we-are" id="who-we-are"></a>

The DAO is being launched by a crew of active analysts and analytic minds in the blockchain ecosystem, supported initially by infrastructure from [Flipside Crypto](https://flipsidecrypto.com/). Flipside is contributing its IP and resources to make this possible. &#x20;

**We welcome any other data provider and any other community of analysts to join. Let's build.**

We believe that access to data for analysis should be open and free; and that all data providers and all analytics platforms help raise the tide of the overall crypto and blockchain ecosystem.

We believe blockchains and protocols should have a clear open format to access analytical minds for on-demand, real-time visualizations, analysis and metrics they need.
