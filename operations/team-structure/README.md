# Team Structure

* **Governors** are pod leaders + genesis council&#x20;
* **Contributors** are team members who works on operational teams that support the system&#x20;
* **Curators** are team members curate raw data into queryable, structured SQL tables. Previous work includes Harmony and Near data curation. Data curation is separate from the three step analytics process.
* **Participants** are members of the MetricsDAO community who participate in our program and use or earn xMETRIC in doing so.&#x20;

Someone can have just one role, or be all of them.&#x20;
