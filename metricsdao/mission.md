# Mission

## MetricsDAO Mission

The purpose of MetricsDAO is to empower analytical minds and enable blockchains and protocols to succeed. It's critical for blockchains and all ecosystem participants to have the data, insights, visualizations and metrics that enable an active, educated and informed community. MetricsDAO will provide the framework for insights to be delivered on-demand and as-needed â€” sourcing community questions, activating analysts, structuring bounties, and quality controlling results. It will be data platform neutral.

MetricsDAO will be a community that benefits analysts of all skill levels. It will allow for multiple modes of participation. Blockchains and protocols will be able to engage with the DAO to get the metrics they need.
