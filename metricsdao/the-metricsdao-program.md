# The MetricsDAO Program

Our three-step Brainstorming, Analytics, and Review system provides a variety of ways for the community and Web3 organizations to generate engagement, education, content, and peer reviewed analytics about protocols or topics they care about.

**Component 1: Community Brainstorming**

⇒ To Engage & Educate

Crypto projects use this component to ask the broader community what analytics they would like to see created. Anyone can submit questions and/or upvote others’ so that the most relevant questions are prioritized, and spam is filtered out.

The goal of the Community Brainstorming Component is to drive engagement with the broader community: to understand what is currently relevant, confusing, or worrisome to them. At the same time, rewarding participants at this level works to educate newcomers on how this protocol works and incentivizes the best ideas to rise to the top.

**Component 2: Analytics**

⇒To Generate Insights & Drive User Onboarding

MetricsDAO’s community of analysts creates the analytics, tooling and content protocols need. With this component DAOs can choose to activate the questions sourced from the community brainstorm, or submit their own questions or tasks that need solving.

Activating MetricsDAO’s analysts allows organizations to not only generate the insights they need, but it also onboards new analysts and new users to their protocol.

**Component 3: Peer Review**

⇒ To Create Legitimacy & Promote Protocols

Peer Review lends authority to insights produced on your project by providing sybil-resistant spam protection and the validation of subject-matter and crypto analytics experts.

The Peer Review Component also allows us to highlight (and promote) the best outputs. This creates valuable marketing for protocols.
