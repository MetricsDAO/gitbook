  MetricsDAO

# xMETRIC

_**Help us test MetricsDAOâ€™s protocol and get rewarded for your early participation on-chain with xMETRIC tokens.**_

Weâ€™ve been experimenting with MetricsDAOâ€™s analytics delivery process for several months now, testing out the structures and incentives that allow for both speed and flexibility when tapping our community of analysts.

Now that we have the right organizational process in place, weâ€™re excited to start iterating on community ownership, token gating, and automation. Which is why weâ€™re launching xMETRIC this Friday.

xMETRIC tokens\*\* are a beta version of MetricsDAOâ€™s future $METRIC token. Think of it as monopoly money that allows us to test parts of our protocol design â€“ with your help.

Your participation in our bounty program will help us test the key actions that community members are meant to take in order to deliver on demand analytics in near real time. As you complete certain actions youâ€™ll earn xMETRIC, which will not only record your early contributions on-chain, but also unlock other gated actions you can take.

This is a massive step for us towards building out our protocol, and automating our [3 step process for on-demand analytics](https://metricsdao.ghost.io/how-to-submit-your-bounty/): (1) Community Brainstorming; (2) Analytics; (3) Peer Review.

xMETRIC will allow us to put all of these components in place, test them, and enforce the right user behaviors -- so that when we're ready to launch, we can turn on the switch and activate something that is already working.ðŸ’ª

xMETRIC holders will be visible on the MetricsDAO leaderboard and entered to win special prizes and perks. As you earn more xMETRIC youâ€™ll also be able to take part in expert-level activities, working with other top analysts in the space (and earning more!).

### **How to Earn xMETRIC**&#x20;

Participants can earn xMETRIC by taking specific actions across MetricsDAOâ€™s three components:

#### **Component 1: Community Brainstorming**

**Submit questions:** Head over to the question vault to submit your questions on the topics and/or protocols currently brainstorming future bounties.

* xMETRIC Needed to Submit: 0&#x20;
* xMETRIC Rewards for Qualified Submissions: 50&#x20;

**Upvote othersâ€™ submission:** In the same question vault you can directly upvote what others are asking, to help prioritize relevant requests.

* xMETRIC Needed to Upvote: 0 xMETRIC&#x20;
* Rewards for Upvote: 5

#### **Component 2: Analytics**

In this component, questions are turned into actionable bounties for our community of analysts to solve by creating analytics, tools and/or content.

* xMETRIC Needed to participate: 0&#x20;
* xMETRIC Rewards for Qualified Submissions: 500&#x20;
* xMETRIC Rewards for Stellar: 1000

Some bounties are gated and only claimable to participants who hold more than 2,000 xMETRIC.

#### Component 3: Peer Review

Analytics, tools and content are peer reviewed by a dynamic network of top analysts in order to validate and score results. This component is gated to participants, and requires a certain amount of xMETRIC for someone to become a Reviewer.

* xMETRIC Needed to participate: 2000&#x20;
* xMETRIC Reward per submission reviewed: 50

#### GodMode NFT Raffle

As soon as you earn your first xMETRIC, youâ€™ll be added to the MetricsDAOâ€™s leaderboard. The more you earn, the higher your rank. The top 100 xMETRIC holders will be entered into a raffle to win [this GodMode NFT](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x903e2f5d42ee23156d548dd46bb84b7873789e44/858), which gives you unlimited access to Flipside Cryptoâ€™s bounties ([learn more here](https://godmode.flipsidecrypto.xyz/))!

\*\*_As part of MetricsDAOâ€™s testing and analysis of the functionality and use of its protocol, xMETRIC tokens may be delivered to the blockchain wallet address that you have connected to the protocol.  xMETRIC tokens will be delivered and used solely for testing and experimental purposes.  xMETRIC tokens are not now, and will never be, transferrable, nor do they confer any rights whatsoever to holders of xMETRIC tokens (including but not limited to voting rights; governance rights; or rights to any profits, losses or distributions of any person, organization, DAO or other entity or group).  In addition, please note that xMETRIC tokens are not METRIC tokens, and do not represent any right or interest in or to METRIC tokens or to any other tokens or assets.  But please enjoy the bragging rights that xMETRIC tokens provide you as an immutable record of your early participation in MetricsDAO testing!_
