# The MetricsDAO Program

Our three-step Brainstorming, Analytics, and Review system provides a variety of ways for the community and Web3 organizations to generate engagement, education, content, and peer reviewed analytics about protocols or topics they care about.

### Component 1: Community Brainstorming

⇒ To Engage & Educate

[Questions are sourced](https://bounty.metricsdao.xyz/) from community members and the most upvoted ones are turned into bounties. Anyone can submit questions and upvote others’. [Learn more about community brainstorms](https://metricsdao.ghost.io/community-brainstorming/).

### **Component 2: Analytics**

⇒To Generate Insights & Drive User Onboarding

Questions are turned into actionable bounties for analysts to solve by creating analytics, tools and/or content. MetricsDAO is vendor-neutral so questions can be solved using any data providers and tools.&#x20;

### **Component 3: Peer Review**

⇒ To Create Legitimacy & Promote Protocols

The insights generated by the community are critiqued and validated by experienced analysts and subject matter experts within the community.
