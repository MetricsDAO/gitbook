# 1- Community Brainstorming

#### **Component 1: Community Brainstorming**

⇒ To Engage & Educate

Crypto projects use this component to ask the broader community what analytics they would like to see created. Anyone can submit questions and/or upvote others’ so that the most relevant questions are prioritized, and spam is filtered out.

The goal of the Community Brainstorming Component is to drive engagement with the broader community: to understand what is currently relevant, confusing, or worrisome to them. At the same time, rewarding participants at this level works to educate newcomers on how this protocol works and incentivizes the best ideas to rise to the top.
