# NEAR

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/1cozsZP8yd4" %}

## **Interested in building?**

**We're actively seeking contributors to help us curate NEAR Protocol data.**&#x20;

If you have spent time as an analyst or analytics engineer this may be for you!

General background:

* SQL&#x20;
* dbt or other modeling frameworks
  * NEAR dbt: [https://github.com/MetricsDAO/near\_dbt](https://github.com/MetricsDAO/near\_dbt)
* Data analysis

Please review the [curation onboarding guide](../data-curator-onboarding/) for more information, if this is new to you!

If youâ€™re interested in joining this group, please reach out to @forg#9122 or @issui#6571 [in MetricsDAO Discord](https://discord.com/channels/902943676685230100/903338987022876702).

## Here from Flipside?

As a reminder, the legacy data structure `flipside_prod_db.mdao_near.<table>` is deprecating, please begin using the models under `near.core.<table>`

Documentation for the data models can be found in the nested page, [here](table-documentation.md).

Have a suggestion for a data model, or just an improvement, but don't want to take the full step of building out a model? The curation team can be best reached on Discord (tag a member or the **@S2 Curator** role) or feel free to open an issue on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/MetricsDAO/near\_dbt/issues)! If you find yourself repeating code and CTEs over and over, and think the community might benefit from a new data model - provide your code snippet or links to queries and those could be developed into data models that go live in Velocity.
