# Projects

Data Curation at MetricsDAO specializes in decoding and surfacing blockchain data that are easy to access via SQL. We want to make blockchain data a public good and empower community driven crypto analytics.

As of August 2022, together with our contributors, we have partnered with Harmony, NEAR and Terra 2.0. Each project is a set of open source [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) models hosted on our [GitHub](https://github.com/metricsDAO/). Presently (Sept 2022), our focus is:

1. &#x20;Ramping up Terra 2.0 data
2. Maintaining the NEAR models

Contributions are open to all. If you have a data model that you'd like to see built out for any of MetricsDAO's open projects, open a PR for the curation pod to review!

## **Interested in building?**
