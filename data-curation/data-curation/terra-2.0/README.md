In July 2022, MetricsDAO applied for a grant via governance vote from the Terra blockchain to ingest and curate Terra 2.0 data with the goal of publishing free accessible Phoenix-1 data using [Flipside Crypto](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/)'s SQL editor.

The governance vote can be found [here](https://station.terra.money/proposal/902), while the full details of the proposal are available in the below link:
