In the [November 9, 2021 MetricsDAO weekly update](https://mirror.xyz/0x3138165f8d21d4869dbD406CD8bc8055CAC8fb6E/T-cnL3rLnjKVPjE1woecZh2rwLRyaDrAmeT6v8565Ik) MetricsDAO announced a new initiative to curate blockchain data leveraging community talent and picked the Harmony blockchain as the first project for this new curation pod.

A number of data tables were curated as part of this initiative, including customized data models for the popular game, DeFi Kingdoms .

As of August 18th, 2022 this project has been sunset and the jobs are no longer running. The data will remain available up until this date for archival purposes.
