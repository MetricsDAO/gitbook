# NEAR

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/1cozsZP8yd4" %}

## Here from Flipside?

As a reminder, the legacy data structure `flipside_prod_db.mdao_near.<table>` is deprecating, please begin using the models under `near.core.<table>`

Documentation for the data models can be found in the nested page, [here](table-documentation.md).

Have a suggestion for a data model, or just an improvement, but don't want to take the full step of building out a model? The curation team can be best reached on Discord (tag a member or the **@S2 Curator** role) or feel free to open an issue on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/MetricsDAO/near\_dbt/issues)! If you find yourself repeating code and CTEs over and over, and think the community might benefit from a new data model - provide your code snippet or links to queries and those could be developed into data models that go live in Velocity.
