# Harmony

In the [November 9, 2021 MetricsDAO weekly update](https://mirror.xyz/0x3138165f8d21d4869dbD406CD8bc8055CAC8fb6E/T-cnL3rLnjKVPjE1woecZh2rwLRyaDrAmeT6v8565Ik) we announced our first partnership with [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) to begin organizing key metrics for their blockchain.&#x20;

This week a group of community members will embark on data interrogation, readying their data for analytics purposes.&#x20;

**We're actively seeking contributors to help us with this important first partnership!** If you have spent time as an analyst or analytics engineer this may be for you :) &#x20;

* Data Curators
* SQL&#x20;
* DBT or other modeling frameworks
* EVM experience
* Harmony experience a bonus

**High Level Project Steps**

* [x] **Create chainwalker for Harmony**
* [x] **Index raw data to Snowflake**
* [x] **Data curation to create tables for analysts (SQL experience needed, DBT modeling helpful) - See more details here:** [**https://metricsdao.gitbook.io/internal-wiki/active-projects/get-involved/harmony-data-curation**](broken-reference)****

Once the data is prepared for analytics, a series of activities can be activated, including development of early analytical outcomes (ie: (client side wallet metrics, smart contracts metrics, NFTs, DEX growth) as well as the sourcing of other analytical needs, structuring requirements for development and allowing for execution on any data platform.
