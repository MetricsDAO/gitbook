# Harmony Data Curation

**Exciting news, MetricsDAO now has a full analytics stack to enable contributors to get involved!**&#x20;

Please reach out to @kate\_chain  #5152 in the [MetricsDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/yrxDvYdcDZ) if you'd like to contribute to the areas outlined below.&#x20;

The data will be curated using DBT & Snowflake with the ability to use any third party tool for analysis that accepts snowflake credentials (how cool is that!?).&#x20;
